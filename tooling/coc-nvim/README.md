# Mare support for VS Code

[![](https://vsmarketplacebadge.apphb.com/version/mare-lang.mare.svg)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mare-lang.mare)

This extension adds to VS Code syntax highlighting and various Intellisense features for the Mare Programming Language.

## Prerequisites

This extension uses [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) to run the Mare language server in the background, so you'll need to have a working installation of Docker and the ability to `docker run` as a non-root user.
