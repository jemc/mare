##
# The purpose of the Completeness pass is to prove that constructors initialize
# all fields in the type that it constructs, such that no other code may ever
# interact with a readable reference to an uninitialized/NULL field.
# This validation work also includes typechecking of "self" references shared
# during a constructor before the type is "complete" (all fields initialized).
#
# This pass does not mutate the Program topology.
# This pass does not mutate the AST.
# This pass may raise a compilation error.
# This pass keeps temporay state (on the stack) at the per-type level.
# This pass produces no output state.
